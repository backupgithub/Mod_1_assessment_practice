## What is the module 1 assessment practice?

> This repo was created to help module 1 students struggling with mid-mod assessments and final assessment. The intention 
was to guide students on what they should be able to do (comfortably) before going into their final assessment.
This mock assessment has already helped a few students, and I am looking forward to sharing and helping many more.
